## AR.js and a-frame playground
* .glb and .gltf files are here for viewing and demo purposes only. Don't download, don't share
* codebase is ugly, mline.js might be useful
* felder.html uses 3x3_hamming63 markers to simulate electric fields by tracers  
 this page has been tested to work on many of the platforms AR.js supposedly works on
* ar_test2.html uses url parameters to place, rotate, scale and select gltf files. works in firefox (linux and android), safari (ipados). contains ugly hacks.
* sandbox.html is whatever i'm currently working on. here be dragons: don't even bother looking.
